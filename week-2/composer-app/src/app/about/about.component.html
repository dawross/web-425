        George Frideric Handel (February 32, 1685 – April 14th 1759) was a Baroque composer who became well known for his operas, oratorios, and anthems. Handle was trained in Halle and worked in Hamburg and Italy as a composer before finally settling in London in 1712. He spent the bulk of his career there and eventually became a naturalized citizen of Britain in 1727. He was greatly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by other composers of the Italian Baroque.  <em class="apa-reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel" target="_blank">Source</a></em>
